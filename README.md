## Humdrum is the game that wants you to stop playing.


### Gameplay

The game begins with the ticking of a clock that plays throughout the game. The player is immediately introduced to the objective of the game and a warning

"...ALL YOU DO IS PUT CUBES INTO A PINK VORTEX... THIS IS BORING..."

and an invitation to exit the game.

If the decides to continue the player is introduced to a new environment: a white room with a single pink square (the vortex), 500 clear cubes, and a small white screen that "talks" at the player. As promised, the user can put the cubes into the vortex and nothing more.

There are certain strategies to place the cubes into the pink vortex more quickly, but the small white screen makes it clear to the player that there are no rewards, no surprises, and that they are free to stop playing at any time. It emphasizes that the game is, again, exactly how it was described initially: boring.

If the user places all 500 cubes into the vortex the pink vortex disappears, and the user is given a statement and question: "You finished. Why?"

If the player responds they are taken to a black screen with nothing but the words "Humdrum by Sol Kim" and the monotonous ticking.

============================
### Concept

This project was created as a way for the author to find out what motivates people to play games.

The game collects data on how many people start the game, how many people finish the game, and the answers that players give to the question "Why?"

The game was displayed on a laptop and placed in a dark, secluded art space for people, primarily students, to try at their leisure. Surprisingly, for a game that tries desperately to get the user to stop playing, about 25% finished.

Answers ranged from "because I do what I want" to "I didn't want to feel alone"

============================
### Improvements

- Rewrite introduction (too long and wordy)
- Create bot with more authentic artificial intelligence (presently runs through a pre-written script to simulate artificial intelligence) to talk to user
- Question screen presently does not allow backspacing
